# Wellness App : basic Angular NS application with 3 pages  
  
***
**Short description of the project:**  
Following my SQL project in another course with Boreal College in Toronto, I have the pleasure to introduce a basic NS 3 pages app with Angular, featuring a commercial video and some wellness products and services gathered in an one-stop shop fictional configuration. After creating a fictive database on MySQL regarding an online shop selling wellness produtcs and services, here comes the application with Angular, Nativescript, based on a tab-navigation template.  
The template used is the tab-navigation angular template.  

I added an API security key and a class called Product to research products on the last page.

**Browse and Search Page**  

As the template allows it, we will have a browse and a search page. The browse page contains a short commercial video featuring the fictive wellness shop.  
It was embedded into the browse.component.html module with WebView.



| Browse | Search

### **Method used**  

I created a blank tab-navigation template with 3 basic pages to fullfill. I created images and a YouTube video broadcasting this fictionnal online shop. I used Angular and made al l the changes on Visual Studio Code without touching the routing modules.
Most of the changes were under .componenent.html or .component.ts or .module.ts
