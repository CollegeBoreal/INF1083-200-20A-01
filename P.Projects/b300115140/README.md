# Wellness App : basic Angular NS application with 3 pages  
  
***
**Short description of the project:**  
Following my SQL project in another course with Boreal College in Toronto, I have the pleasure to introduce a basic NS 3 pages app with Angular, featuring a commercial video and some wellness products and services gathered in an one-stop shop fictional configuration. After creating a fictive database on MySQL regarding an online shop selling wellness produtcs and services, here comes the application with Angular, Nativescript, based on a tab-navigation template.
